As a former teacher with a neurodivergent child, she saw firsthand the challenges that students, parents, and educators faced in understanding and supporting brain differences. What started as informal workshops in local schools quickly grew into a grassroots movement to foster inclusion, acceptance, and understanding in the community.</p></div>

With the help of passionate volunteers and educators, AWARE began offering resources to teachers, parents, and students, helping them understand neurodiversity and build more inclusive classrooms. The mission was clear: equip educators and students with the knowledge and tools to support neurodivergent individuals, creating a more understanding and accepting world.</p></div>

What started as small workshops had expanded into national programs, providing free educational kits, lesson plans, and guest speakers to schools. Teachers and administrators recognized the impact of AWARE’s resources, and many shared stories of how their classrooms had transformed into safe, inclusive environments where every child could thrive. AWARE’s work was beginning to reach hearts far and wide, as it touched the lives of both neurodivergent individuals and their peers.</p></div>
